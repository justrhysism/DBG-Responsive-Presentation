			<h3>
				Print Vocabulary
			</h3>
			<p>
				We have adopted print vocabulary for the web.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Masthead</li>
				<li>Whitespace</li>
				<li>Leading</li>
				<li>Our favourite: the Fold</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Natural to borrow existing terms which we're already familiar with.</p>
		</article>

			<h3>Deeper Borrowing</h3>
			<p>Another word we've borrowed whether we're familiar with it or not:</p>

			<h3>Canvas</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A painter selects the size and type of canvas they wish to work with.</li>
				<li>A sculptor chooses a size and type of stone to start from.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Immediately provides a boundary for the work to come.</p>

			<h3>Defining our Canvas</h3>

			<h3>Flawed Process</h3>
			<p>
				Imagine a painter selecting their canvas, finishing their work, and then handing their work off to someone
				to cut into pieces and try to glue it all back together on a canvas of a different shape and size.
			</p>
			<p>
				Which then changes for each person who looks at it...
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h3>Constraining</h3>
			<p>We define our canvas in Photoshop, immediately establishing constraints:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixing layout width, assuming minimum screen resolution</li>
				<li>Defining type in pixels</li>
				<li>Fixing height on certain elements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Eventually, the design is approved. We then immediately cut it to pieces and try to shove the design
				into our <em>real</em> canvas.
			</p>

			<h3>The Browser: Our <em>Real</em> Canvas</h3>
			<p class="white">A canvas which:</p>
			<ul class="white">
				<li>Can be any size</li>
				<li>Be on many different devices</li>
				<li>Display fonts differently</li>
				<li>Even display colours differently depending on the screen</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h3>But We've Always Done It That Way...</h3>
			<p>Our current process is comfortable because it's what we <em>know</em>.</p>
			<p>We like setting constraints and boundaries; it gives us something to work with.</p>
			<p>The problems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Many browsers</li>
				<li>More devices</li>
				<li>
					<p>Even more users, and their individual:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Font settings</li>
						<li>Screen sizes</li>
						<li>Display colours and quality</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The list does go on...</li>
